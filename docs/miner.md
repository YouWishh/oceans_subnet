# Oceans Subnet 66 • Miner Guide (v0)

**Last updated:** July 2025  
**Applies to:** Oceans Subnet 66 (Bittensor Network, version 0)

## 1. Clarification
To miner on Oceans66 you don't need to run a miner. Validator will fetch your liquidity positions from the coldkey you registered with.

## 2. High‑Level Miner Role
1. **Neuron Registration**  
   * You register a *neuron* on Subnet 66 using your **coldkey** and **hotkey**.  
   * In SN66 a single coldkey will hold the liquidity positions

2. **Liquidity Provision**  
   * After registration, your primary duty is **to supply liquidity** to Bittensor subnet pools.  
   * You are free to allocate funds wherever you believe yields the best economic result, rewards scale with how closely your allocations match the *community‑voted* weight vector published by holders of the governance token **sn66 α‑Stake**.

3. **Reward Collection**  
   * At the end of every **epoch** the subnet measures:
     * **Your total liquidity** (USD value) in each eligible pool.  
     * **The weight** assigned to each pool by α‑Stake voting.  
   * Rewards flow back to the **same hotkey** that owns your neuron

4. **Continuous Adjustment**  
   * Because weights (community priorities) and market conditions both move, miners who **adapt fastest** usually capture a larger slice of emissions over time.

## 3. Strategies for Effective Mining
1. **Monitor Weight Changes Frequently**  
   The most common reason for under‑performance is sticking to yesterday’s allocation when the community has shifted focus elsewhere.

2. **Diversify When in Doubt**  
   Holding a balanced basket of pools can hedge against sudden weight rotations.
